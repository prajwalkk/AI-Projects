7: Eating all the dots.  
   1st Heuristic idea was to implement nearest node and Furthest goal food and add both of them and sent the path as heuristic. But it was not admissible. 
   therefore used average of min and max distance as heuristic
   Discussed this heuristic with classmate Pramodh Acharya UIN: 671820928.
   We implemented seperate strategies, though.
